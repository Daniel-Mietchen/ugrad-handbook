Undergraduate Handbook for the Department of Computer Science at the Unviersity of Virginia
===========================================================================================

This is the LaTeX source of the UVa CS undergraduate handbook that is made available to all computing majors.  The department has three undergraduate majors (BS CS, BA CS, and BS CpE).

The current version will always be available online at http://www.cs.virginia.edu/acad/

People should NOT look at the current working copy (in the various .tex files in this repository) for the current version -- the .tex files herein are typically works in progress, and are often edited before the changes that they describe actually take effect.  Instead, look at the latest version in the releases/ directory, as PDFs of all the formal releases (the versions that are printed) are included there.

The primary author of this handbook is Aaron Bloomfield (aaron@virginia.edu, @bloomfieldaaron, github.com/aaronbloomfield).  If you have any suggestions, corrections, etc., please either [execute a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) or contact him.
