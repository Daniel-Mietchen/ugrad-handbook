Four courses selected with the approval of the student's advisor from
the list of computing-related courses approved by the BA CS
committee. These courses are offered by departments other than
Computer Science, and should either provide fundamental computing
depth and background or explore applications of computing to arts and
sciences fields. 

This is a list of the courses that are generally approved as
integration electives. This list is not meant to be exhaustive: if you
find a course that is not on the list that appears to satisfy the
goals of an integration elective, discuss with your advisor or the BA
Program Director if it should count as an integration elective for
you.

Some of these courses are not offered regularly, and some courses may
have prerequisites. The list of integration electives may change
slightly from year to year.  You can always check the current list of
integration electives on SIS.  The list below is according to SIS as
of September 2013.

\paragraph{Using other courses.}  If a student would like to use a
course not on the above list as an integration elective, they should
first contact their academic advisor.  Their advisor can work with the
student to come up with a good argument as to why the course should
qualify, and once the advisor approves it, send it to the BA CS
Director at \bacsdirectoremail.  Alternatively, if the advisor
prefers, s/he can just send the student to BA CS director to get
approval for a requirement exception.  This will require a SIS
exception to be entered for the student;
\ifthenelse{\boolean{ba-int-list-sis}}{see the full CS undergraduate handbook}{see section~\ref{sec:sisexceptions} (page~\pageref{sec:sisexceptions})}
for the manual SIS exception process.
