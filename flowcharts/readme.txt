Prior to 2010, the flowchart was done in Visio.  Starting after 2010
(and with the 2013 flowchart), it was done in dia.  The PDF is now
generated by extracting that one page from the (letter-sized)
handbook, and removing the section number, header line, and page
number.  This also requires moving the "(Updated <date>)" text over to
be left-aligned with the title above it (and note that the title no
longer has a section number).

The PNG image is created by running it through pdftoppm and then
pnmtopng.  Then load it into gimp and do an auto-crop.  It should
already be in grayscale mode.
