Computing students:

Here is some info about the spring course schedule.  

1) We believe the COD for CS courses is now in fact correct.  If I hear 
differently, I'll let you know ASAP!

2) CS 462, Databases, does have a time-conflict with CS340's lab.  
Unfortunately, despite efforts to resolve this, it can't be fixed and 
students won't be able to take both of these.  If you're a 3rd year BSCS 
or CpE major, consult your advisor to see if you want to delay CS340 
until your 4th year.

3) At the end of this are descriptions of some of the new courses being 
taught this spring.  (Except for CS 351, Malware -- I didn't get a 
description for it.)

4) Prof. Skadron's course CS433 counts as a computer architecture 
elective for SEAS BSCS majors (i.e. Engineering CS majors, not CpE 
majors) who are using the most recent rules and want to take something 
besides ECE435.  This is a modified version of the course he taught last 
year, CS 454.  Right now we don't think you can get credit for both 
CS433 and ECE435.

5) We've submitted a request to get CS453 to count towards the 
Engineering Business minor.  I'll post news about this when I hear the 
outcome.

6) BACS students who have not taken CS150 yet should take it this 
spring.  It's not offered in the fall term.

7) Reminder: CS390 is now taught as CS290, and all 2nd year SEAS 
Computer Science majors must take it in their 2nd year.  (It's not 
required of CpE or BACS students, and in fact doesn't count as an 
elective for them.)  Last year's website is here: 
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~horton/cs390/
If you're a third year and did not take CS290 last year, take it this year.

8) CS494, Object-oriented Design, is likely to be taught next summer by 
me (Prof. Horton).  This counts as a CS elective, and the pre-req is 
CS216.  It's a software course focusing on design issues, including 
design patterns, UML, etc.  It will run in the 5-week session that 
starts around July 12.

(9) Because of the substantial overlap between CS 433 (Advanced
Computer Architecture) and ECE 435 (Computer Organization and Design),
students who have taken CS435 cannot take receive credit for CS 433.
This applies to all majors and minors who were thinking of signing up
for CS433 next spring (or later).

Note: students who already took Prof. Skadron's CS454 class *last
year* and who have completed or are completing ECE435 this term
(i.e. 063) *can* get credit for both of these. We did not discover the
overlap until after you took both courses, so it would not be fair to
punish you by changing the rules after the fact.

(10) The course CS351, Malware, will be very similar to
Prof. Davidson's previous course "Dark Arts".  The pre-req is CS216.
The course can count as a CS elective for BSCS students, BSCpE
students, BACS students and CS minors.


Course descriptions that I have are listed below.  If you have other 
questions, consult your advisor.  I may post follow-ups to this if there 
other things you should know.

====================================
Here's a description of Prof. Skadron's CS433.

Advanced Computer Architecture will teach the concepts necessary to 
understand the architecture and organization of current high-performance 
microprocessors (such as pipelining, dataflow, branch prediction, and 
out of order execution), with a special focus on preparing students to 
understand the challenges presented by highly multicore chips. Prereq: 
CS 333

=================================
Prof. Marty Humphrey's course CS 451: Distributed Systems is described here:
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~humphrey/cs451/
It *is* open to undergrad students (there was a mistake in the COD earlier).
You must take CS414 (operating systems) at the same time as CS451 if you 
haven't already had it.

==================================
CS 494: Computational Science & Engineering 1.
The course will introduce computational science to students from the 
perspective of a problem solving environment,
e.g. Matlab (Mathworks) or the open-source Octave (Gnu Project).  

Prerequisites: To ensure a minimum basic preparation there are two
prerequisites, two semesters of calculus and some programming experience
(language not an issue).

Topics:
.         Computer basics, numerical issues, memory limits, etc.
.         Software basics, programming in the abstract, complexity and O()
notation, flow control, IO, programming in a problem solving environment
(Matlab)
.         Numerical Methods;
o       Solution of systems of linear and nonlinear equations.
o       Functional optimization.
o       Solution of linear and nonlinear ODEs and PDEs.
.         Simulation and modeling (problem, theory, model, implementation,
assessment).
.         Data analysis and visualization.
