<h3><a name="bscs">BS CS requirements</a></h3>

<p>The degree requirements for the BS CS, including elective
information, are now contained in the new <a

<ul>
	<li>Note: &nbsp;A student
can choose to graduate under any set of set of requirements that were
in effect while he or she was a student at the university, but they
must choose one of the sets listed below. They cannot "mix and match"
changes from various rule-sets. &nbsp;For example, a student using the
"Fall 2004" rules below&nbsp; (no general electives) is not allowed to
take something other than ECE 435.<br>
	<br></li>
	<li>Requirements effective Fall 2006 (<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f06v2.doc">doc</a>,
	<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f06v2.pdf">pdf</a>).&nbsp; Differences from previous rules are:</li>

    
    <ul>
		<li>Computer Architecture elective: &nbsp;ECE
435 is no longer an absolute requirement. &nbsp;Instead, students must
choose one course from a list of "computer architecture electives."
&nbsp;The list of acceptable courses is <a href="#ECE435">below</a>.</li>
		<li>Because of the above change, a student can now graduate with 124.5 credits.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Requirements effective Fall 2005 (<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f05.doc">doc</a>,
	<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f05.pdf">pdf</a>). &nbsp;Differences from previous rules are:</li>

    
    <ul>
		<li>General education requirements. &nbsp;Students
must complete 9 credits of General Education courses in addition to 9
credits of HSS. Students now only need 9 technical electives credits
(at most 3 credits at 200-level) and 3 credits of completely
unrestricted electives.</li>
		<li>CS 390 is now CS 290 and should be taken in the 2nd year.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Requirements effective Fall 2004 (<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f04.doc">doc</a>,
	<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f04.pdf">pdf</a>).&nbsp; Differences from previous rules are:</li>

    
    <ul>
		<li>Change in math requirements.
&nbsp;Students must take APMA 310 and then must choose two from APMA
213, APMA 308 or APMA 321. &nbsp; This means a student could graduate
with 125.5 credits not 126.5.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Requirements effective Fall 2001 (<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f01.doc">doc</a>,
	<a href="bscs-checklist-rules-f01.pdf">pdf</a>)</li>
</ul>

<!-- <h3>BS CS <a name="BS_Elective_information">Elective information</a></h3>

<p>Below lists what courses count for what elective requirements.</p>

<ul>

	<li><b>CS electives</b> (4 required): any 3 credit CS class at the 300 level or 
	above (updated as of 10-2-06).&nbsp; Obviously, a course that is fulfilling 
	another requirement can't also count as a CS elective.&nbsp; If you take more than 4 CS electives, you can count any additional course(s) 
	as either a technical elective or an unrestricted elective.&nbsp; ECE 436 
	also counts as a CS elective (but not for CpE majors, of course).</li>

	<li><b><a name="ECE435">Computer architecture elective</a></b>: as of March 2006, the list includes: 
ECE 435; Parallel Computing (CS 451);
		Advanced Computer Architecture (CS 433); and Computer Organization (CS 654).</li>

	<li><b>Science elective </b>(1 required): BIOL 201, BIOL 202, CHEM 152, CHEM 162, 
	ECE 200, MSE 209, or PHYS 252</li>

	<li><b>APMA elective</b>: Must take APMA 310 and choose two from: APMA 213, APMA 308 
	or APMA 312</li>

	<li><b>HSS electives </b>(3 required): see the
	<a href="http://www.seas.virginia.edu/advising/undergradhandbook.php#hss">list in the SEAS Undergraduate Handbook</a></li>

	<li><b>Technical electives </b>(3 required): Technical electives are courses whose 
	major emphasis is mathematics, science, or engineering. Technical Electives 
	can be at the 200-level, but at least two must be 300-level or higher.&nbsp; 
	See <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/curriculum/advising.html"> this page</a> 
	for more details, including courses that do not count as technical 
	electives.&nbsp; There is no formal list, but you can ask if you are unsure 
	if a course counts or not.</li>

	<li><b>General Education elective </b>(aka GenEd) (3 required): see the page
	<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/curriculum/distribution_requirements.html">here</a> about GenEd electives.</li>

	<li><b>Unrestricted elective </b>(1 required): Any graded course in the University, 
	with a few exceptions.&nbsp; From the
	<a href="http://www.seas.virginia.edu/advising/undergradhandbook.php">SEAS 
	Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>:<br>
	<i>All Unrestricted Electives may be chosen from any graded course in the 
	University except mathematics courses below MATH 131, including STAT 110 and 
	112, and courses that substantially duplicate any others offered for the 
	degree, including PHYS 201, PHYS 202, CS 110, CS 111, CS 120, or any 
	introductory programming course. Students in doubt as to what is acceptable 
	to satisfy a degree requirement should obtain the approval of their advisor 
	and the dean's office, Thornton Hall, Room A122. APMA 109 counts as a three 
	credit unrestricted elective for students.</i></li>

	<li><b>STS 2xx/3xx elective </b>(1 required): Any STS course at the 200-level or 
	300-level</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that classes that receive no grade (such as TCC 100, or classes that are 
audited) do not count for anything.&nbsp; ROTC classes can count towards the 
unrestricted elective, and can count for 6 of the 9 general education elective 
credits.</p>

<h3><a name="BA_CS_Requirements">BA CS Requirements</a></h3>

<p>Below is a quick summary of the BA CS requirements.&nbsp; The full 
requirements can be found
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/ba/curriculum.html">here</a>.&nbsp; The 
department's HEGIS code (for the major selection form) is 154934.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>CS courses</b>: there are 6 required CS classes: CS 150, 205 (201 can 
	substitute), 202, 216, 333, and 432</li>
	<li><b>Computing electives</b>: 4 are required.&nbsp; Currently, any 
	300-level or 400-level course counts, as does CS/ECE 230.</li>
	<li><b>Integration electives</b>: see
	<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/ba/integration.html">here</a> for the 
	list of what is considered an integration elective.</li>
	<li><b>CLAS Competency requirements</b>: see page 64 of the undergraduate 
	record (first and second writing requirements, and foreign language)</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="Rodman_Scholars">Rodman Scholars Specific Information</a></h3>

<ul>

	<li>The requirement for STS 101 is changed to an additional HSS elective</li>

	<li>ENGR 141R counts as ENGR 162</li>

	<li>PHYS 142R counts for PHYS 142E <i>and</i> PHYS 142W</li>
	<li>PHYS 241R counts for PHYS 241E <i>and</i> PHYS 
	241W</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="Advanced_Placement">Advanced Placement Information</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Computer Science: A 5 on the AB test will receive credit for CS 101 <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span>
CS 201. &nbsp;A 4 on the AB test OR a 5 on the A test will receive
credit for CS 101. &nbsp;If the AP was not in Java, proficiency in Java
must be demonstrated prior to taking CS 201 (CS 201 is reuquired for
CS, SIE, and EE). &nbsp;There is also a placement exam before the fall
semester that will allow one to place out of CS 101, but does <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> allow credit to be received for the course -- one must then take another 3 hour CS or technical course.&nbsp; 
	The placement exam covers all topics taught in the course.&nbsp; For the 
	current semester's syllabus, see the
	<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs101/">CS 101 course website</a>.</li>
  <li>Biology: A 4 or a 5 on the AP test receives credit for BIOL 201 and BIOL 202, which can be used to satisfy the science elective.</li>
  <li>Chemistry:&nbsp;A 4 or a 5 on the Chemistry AP will receive
credit for CHEM 151 and CHEM 152. &nbsp;The lab (CHEM 151L) must still
be taken.</li>
  <li>Physics: A 4 or a 5 on the C level part I (Mechanics) exam receives credit for PHYS 142E. &nbsp;A
4 or a 5 on the C level part II (E&amp;M) exam receives credit for PHYS
241E. &nbsp;No lab credit is given, so PHYS 142W and PHYS 241W must
still be taken. &nbsp;A 4 or a 5 on the Physics B test receives credit
for PHYS 201 and PHYS 202 -- neither of these classes count towards
SEAS requirements (not even an unrestricted elective), but will be listed on the transcript.</li>
  <li>Mathematics: A 5 on the BC Calculus exam will receive credit for
APMA 111; students should then sign up for APMA 212. &nbsp;A 4 in the
BC Calculus exam, or a 5 on the AB exam can take the APMA 111 placement
exam to gain exemption, but not credit, for APMA 111 (this placement
exam&nbsp;is required to confirm credit for IB courses and dual
enrollment calculus courses taken in high school). &nbsp;Two semesters
of transfer credit (which&nbsp;corresponds to calculus II) is required to receive credit for APMA 111. </li>
  <li>STS: A 5 on the English Language AP exam will get credit for STS
101; however, an HSS elective (in addition to the other HSS electives
required) must be taken in STS 101's place. &nbsp;A 720 or better on
the SAT (or SAT II) writing test will be exempt from (but not receive
credit for) STS 101; again, an HSS elective must be taken instead.</li>
  <li>Other: Credit for HSS or unrestricted electives is normally
awarded for a 4 or a 5 on the appropriate AP test (or a 5, 6, or 7 on
the equivalent IB Higher Level test).</li>

<h3><a name="Administrative_Issues">Administrative Issues</a></h3>
<p>Some of the fine print has changed over time, and is listed here mostly as a 
reference.</p>
<p>On 30 October 2006, the CS faculty voted and approved the following 
recommendations (note that recommendation 3 still requires SEAS approval):</p>
<ul>
	<li>RECOMMENDATION #1: For the three required BSCS General Education 
	electives, at most one performance-oriented or skills-development courses 
	may be allowed to count.</li>
	<li>RECOMMENDATION #1A: Also, the BSCS General Education electives will have 
	this restriction: &quot;Courses on communication in the student's native 
	language, regardless of their level, may not be used to satisfy this 
	requirement.&quot; (This is the same wording used for the SEAS HSS electives.)</li>
	<li>RECOMMENDATION #2: For the BSCS degree, a CS elective is any CS course 
	at the 300 level or higher, unless such a course's description indicates it 
	does not count as a CS elective, and provided that the given elective is not 
	being used to fulfill another requirement for the BS CS degree.</li>
	<li>RECOMMENDATION #3: CS302, Discrete Math II, be re-named to be Theory of 
	Computation. The current course description in the undergrad record already 
	reflects this, and would be maintained. This is: &quot;Introduces computation 
	theory including grammars, finite state machines and Turing machines; and 
	graph theory. Also demonstrates the importance of these topics through 
	several software projects.&quot;</li>
