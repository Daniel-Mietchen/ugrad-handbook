BS degree readies students for careers that provide
both personal and societal rewards. As creators of information
technologies our graduates are reaching out to people and the world by
supporting and enhancing communication, health care, entertainment,
scientific inquiry, transportation, business, and almost any other
endeavor you can imagine. 
	
	<p> 

The full requirements for the Bachelors of Science in Computer Science
can be found in our <a href="ugradhandbook.pdf">undergraduate
handbook</a> (<a
href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">PDF</a>).
These requirements are the same as what was available online
previously, and are now contained solely within this handbook.  The
handbook also contains the requirements for the minor in computer
science.  Printed copies of the handbook are available in the computer
science main office (Olsson 204).  The course dependency graph in the
handbook is also available as a <a href="Cs-course-flowchart.gif">gif

<h2><a name="errata">Errata</a></h2>
<p>There are a few errata from the published version of the
undergraduate handbook -- these are listed below, and will of course
be corrected in future versions (the next printed version is expected
to come out in the summer of 2008).</p>
<ul>
<li>SYS 323 does, in fact, count as a technical elective.  It does not
count as a CS elective.  CS 305 is similar in content to SYS 323, and
counts as a CS elective.  This is on page 12 of the printed version,
and page 8 of the online version.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="addendums">Addendums</a></h2>
<p>A few points of interest came up after the publication of the
handbook, and will be included in the next version (scheduled to come
out this summer).  Until then, they will appear below.</p>

<ul>

<li>Transfer credit: The Engineering school handles transfer credit,
such as from an AP course or transfer from another school.  The credit
will appear on your VISTAA report, along with the UVa courses that you
received credit for.  Note that the credit amounts need to match -- so
if you are getting credit for APMA 212 (Multivariate Calculus), which
is a 4 credit course, the number of credits you transfer in should
(ideally) also be 4 credit hours.  If it does not (your equilvalent
course at another school was only 3 credits), you will have to take
another math or technical elective credit to make up for the
discrepancy.  Note that placing out of a course (such as CS 101, APMA
212, etc.) through the respective placement exam does not give credit
-- and thus the credits need to be made up through other courses (in
the case of CS 101, 3 credits of a technical elective will fill that
spot; in the case of APMA 212, 4 credits of math or a techincal
elective will fill that spot).  AP exams do give course credit.</li>

<li>Transfer credit: Half of the 128 credits that one uses to graduate
must be earned at UVa.  Thus, if you transfer with more than 64
credits, you must still take 64 credits at UVa.</li>

<li>A few classes have been ruled as not counting for the General
Education elective.  Included in this list are ASTR 121 and ASTR 124.
If you are unsure if a course counts or not, please see your academic
advisor.</li>

<li>There are a number of ECON courses that are listed as not counting
as HSS electives -- most of these count as technical electives.  The
one exception (as of the 2007-2008 undergraduate record) is ECON 435
(Corporate Finance), which counts as a general education elective, not
a technical elective.  The rest of the ECON courses that do not count
as an HSS elective but do count as a technical elective are: ECON 371
(Introduction to Statistical Analysis), ECON 372 (Introduction to
Regression Analysis), ECON 381 (Mathematical Statistics for
Economists), ECON 401 (Game Theory), ECON 471 (Economic Forecasting),
ECON 509 (Introduction to Mathematical Economics I), and ECON 510
(Introduction to Mathematical Economics II).  Note that ECON 381 is no
longer offered by the Economics department.  Also note that, due to
substantial overlap, one cannot count ECON 371 as a technical elective
if you also took APMA 312 (Statistics).</li>
